DESCRIPTION 
===========

This is the framework for efficient and flexible graph mining based 
on the Galois programming system. It uses the bliss library [1][2] 
for graph isomorphism check. The license for this library is in the
bliss directory: note that **it does not use the same license as
the rest of Galois**.

INPUT
===========

We support four input graph format: **gr**, **txt**, **adj**, **mtx**.

We mostly use **adj** format as also used by Arabesque and RStream.
The **adj** format takes as input graphs with the following formats:

* **Graphs label on vertex(default)**
```
# <num vertices> <num edges>
<vertex id> <vertex label> [<neighbour id1> <neighbour id2> ... <neighbour id n>]
<vertex id> <vertex label> [<neighbour id1> <neighbour id2> ... <neighbour id n>]
...
```

We currently do not support graphs label on edges

Vertex ids are expected to be sequential integers between 0 and (total number of vertices - 1).

BUILD
===========

1. Run cmake at BUILD directory `cd build; cmake -DUSE_EXP=1 ../`

2. Run `cd <BUILD>/lonestar/experimental/fsm; make -j`

RUN
===========

The following are a few example command lines.

-`$ ./tc <path-to-graph> -t 40`
-`$ ./kcl <path-to-graph> -k=3 -t 40`
-`$ ./motif <path-to-graph> -k=3 -t 40`
-`$ ./fsm <path-to-graph> -k=3 -minsup=300 -t 40`
